<h2>Brief History</h2>
	<p>
<a href="right_content.jpg" class="body-picture" title="The Artillery Promos 2010 - Photo by Travis Tank"><img src="right_content.jpg" alt="The Artillery Promo" class="inline-picture" width="150px" style="float:right;margin-left:15px;"></a>The Artillery is a four-piece band formed out of Round Rock, Texas. They have been together since 2000, playing shows regionally since 2002, and nationally since 2006.  Hailing from a suburb of the largest music scene in Texas, Chris Ellis, a swagger-savvy drummer, and Jonathan Macias, a natural born rocker, were urged to start a rock band. After trying out a few unfitting candidates, they came across a talented voice that went by the name of Dean Danger. Chris Reyes, another local artist, had proven himself to be the missing link that would bring The Artillery to their full potential.</p>
<p>Now that they were fully staffed, they began to write songs that combined energetic guitar leads with catchy vocals. The Artillery recorded their first E.P. entitled 'Fear Is In' with producer Paul Soroski, and released it on June 24th 2007. Throughout 'Fear is In' there's a reoccurring theme of determination, strength through struggle, and an unwavering will to overcome all obstacles. The E.P. serves as a solid introduction to a band destined for bigger things.  After their release they toured regionally, and have since made a name for themselves around the Lone Star State.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/llK2PkItNKw?autoplay=1" class="iframe video"><span class="overlay-play"></span><img src="images/video_thumb.jpeg" alt="The Artillery Live" width="150px"><span class="caption">Video For "See The Light"</span></a>Soon after 'Fear Is In' they continued writing non-stop, in order to finish their first full-length, entitled 'Kings of the World'. After 2 years in the making, 'KOTW' has a mix-match of many genres, only to prove their ability to write in totally different mind-sets. 'KOTW' has a message of breaking boundaries, getting out of monotonous situations, and exploring life for yourself.   After it's release on June 26th 2009, their popularity only gained more. This time through the internet as well, selling over fifteen-hundred albums on iTunes and other various online media forms. The Artillery also got to #14 out of thousands in an online battle for Austin City Limits Festival.</p>
<p>The Artillery self-recorded a new full-length concept album called 'Lighthouse.’ This album tells a harrowing tale of a man getting lost, and shares in his journey to find his way home; in this story, like many others, there are a variety of lessons and emotions up for interpretation by the audience. While every song lends itself to David Archer’s story, they do not have any trouble standing alone and remaining enjoyable outside of the context of the album. When listened to in its entirety 'Lighthouse' takes you on an audible journey through the power of love, the hint of hope, and the trials David Archer went through to get back home so that he could continue his life. The Artillery is striving for a hopeful world, not only in 'Lighthouse', but in their musical existence as well.  'Lighthouse' was released on August 24th 2012, and in doing so, The Artillery has embarked on another leg of their journey: to share the music that they love, to anyone they can.</p>
